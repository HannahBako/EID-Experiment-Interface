                <p style="text-align: left;">You have been tasked with creating a visual data story for a blog post discussing the effects of global warming on the US atmospheric temperature. 
                    You have been provided with a dataset on average daily temperature recordings from weather stations in the US. 
                    You need to create a centerpiece visualization for the blog post that highlights the following key point: <br><br>
                    <b><i style="text-align: center;">
                        Earth’s temperature has risen by 0.14° Fahrenheit (0.08° Celsius) per decade since 1880, 
                        but the rate of warming since 1981 is more than twice that: 0.32° F (0.18° C) per decade.
                    </i></b>

                    Palm oil production has been at the forefront of climate talk as a major driver of deforestation. 
                    This has led to drastic changes in consumer behavior as companies and people move away from consuming/using palm oil-based products. 
                    But is this claim true? Is palm oil production any more destructive than other vegetable oil crops being produced? <br>
                    You have been selected to create a visualization that will be submitted to the Iron Viz competition and have been provided with a dataset on: <br>
                    <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>The amount of land used to produce various vegetable crops</li>
                        <li>The expected yield for vegetable oil crops</li>
                        <li>The drivers for deforestation in Indoesia</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Your task is to create a visualization that communicates two key insights: <br>
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc !important">
                            <b><i>Only 16% of direct deforestation was driven by palm oil plantations. 
                                Infact most of the land used replaced by palm oil plantations were previously logged forests or scrubland (land destroyed by fire or other natural elements)</i></b>
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc !important">
                            <b><i>Compared to other vegetable oil crops, Palm oil has higher yield per hectare of land. Hence requiring less land use to meet global demand.</i></b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Your visualization will be judged based on how novel your design is and how well you communicate the key insights to your audience.</p>
